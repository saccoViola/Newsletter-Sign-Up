# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message solution

This is a solution to the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

In the learning path I'm following on Frontend Mentor I'm right now focusing on forms and this is a nice challenge to practise it. 
I'm also practising HTML and CSS, trying to stick to the original design as much as I can. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
